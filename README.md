# polite-speech-in-human-and-llms
Repo for cogsci 2025 "Polite Speech Generation in Humans and Language Models" and preprint "Comparing human and LLM politeness strategies in free production"


For the data collection:


- I will need:
  - code and data to get LLM multi-choice responses;
  - code and data to get LLM free-responses
  - code and data to get LLM annotation results

 I will also need all the code files for processing and figure generation.

 I will also need a requirement.txt file

 I will also need to write this readme file in a nice way


I may also need to share the web design code as well.
